## Sublime Text 3

1. Download latest version: http://www.sublimetext.com/3

2. If a previous version was installed the data folder needs to be deleted (or moved) to revert the app to a freshly installed state. Depending on your operating system, this folder is located:
  * OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3
  * Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3
  * Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-3

    Sublime Text will first have to be closed and then the data directory can be deleted or moved. The next time Sublime Text is launched it should be in a freshly installed state.

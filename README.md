# dotfiles

This is just a place to keep all of my settings and config files for various apps. Its a pain having to manually configure all of my apps after every fresh install or upgrade. This will hopefully speed things up a bit.

Along with just having the actual config files in here I'm also trying to keep a list of setup steps for each app.

## Sublime Text 3

1. Download the latest version: http://www.sublimetext.com/3 or http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev

2. To revert to a freshly installed state from a previous install you will need to delete the data folder. Depending on your operating system, this folder is located:
  * OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3
  * Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3
  * Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-3

Just a place to keep my various settings and configuration files for everything.

## Sublime Text 3

1. Download the latest version: http://www.sublimetext.com/3 or http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev

2. To revert to a freshly installed state from a previous install you will need to delete the data folder. Depending on your operating system, this folder is located:
  * OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3
  * Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3
  * Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-3
